AEUX is a set of panels for Figma, Sketch and After Effects. Transfer layers as you need them with the least amount of friction between visual design and motion.

Formerly known as Sketch2AE, AEUX is designed to keep up with the newest ways people are designing for screens. Spell it out or say it like A-Yo.
