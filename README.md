# [AEUX](https://aeux.io/)

Built on the original [After Effects][56a59ddd] layer transfer system, Sketch2AE, AEUX now supports Catalina updates to [Sketch][66b609ab] and browser based [Figma](https://figma.com). UX motion design in Ae has never been easier to get started.   

> This is not an official Google product. Motion designers at Google just kinda like it a lot. Built by [Adam Plouff][8638464d].
