tagline: UX motion design with the tools you like
actionText: Get started →
actionLink: /guide/
features:
- title: Real layers
  details: Build visual design layers in After Effects as editable as possible with shape and text layers. Images will be exported and built as files when needed –even from Figma in the browser.
- title: Grouping/Ungrouping
  details: In Ae, a layer exists either in the current comp or somewhere else –which is very different from the grouping in most design apps. It is now possible to group and ungroup precomped layers.
- title: Flexibility
  details: AEUX is less as an exporter and more of a portal between design and motion. Transfer what you need instead of organizing hundreds of layers before even setting a keyframe.
