- Click to open the panel

### For non-Googlers
Requirements: [Figma desktop](https://www.figma.com/downloads/)

The plugin is not yet published on [figma.com/plugins](http://figma.com/plugins) so the installation process is a little more involved right now.

1. Copy the contents of the download zip **AEUX_{{ $frontmatter.currentVersion }}/Figma/** to a location that is *not* your downloads folder (if you delete these files after installing through the *Development* menu, it will break the plugin)

3. Navigate to the file **AEUX_{{ $frontmatter.currentVersion }}/Figma/manifest.json**
