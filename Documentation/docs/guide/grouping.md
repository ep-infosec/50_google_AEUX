### Group and ungroup
Precomping can simplify a long list of layers in a single comp but removes layers from the main work area. It is now possible to un-precomp layers in After Effects for the first time while adding a lot of smarts to precomping.

### Toggle visibility
Group layers are just rectangle guide layers (layers that do not render) but can help transform multiple elements when dragged around the comp. Click to toggle all guide layer visibility to make dragging much easier.

### Delete guide layers
If groups arenâ€™t your thing and you end up with a bunch of unnecessary layers, click to remove all guide layers from the comp.
